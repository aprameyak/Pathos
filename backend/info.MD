# Pathos Backend Service

The Pathos backend is a Flask-based API service that provides real-time emotion recognition using the DeepFace framework, deployed on Hugging Face Spaces at https://aprameyak-pathos.hf.space and processes screenshots sent from the Chrome extension. The service analyzes facial expressions and returns detailed emotion classifications with confidence scores and face detection coordinates. The API accepts POST requests to /analyze_screen with base64-encoded image data and returns JSON arrays containing emotion results, with each result including the dominant emotion, confidence scores for all seven emotions (happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise, disgust, neutral), and precise face region coordinates. The service is optimized for Hugging Face Spaces with 2 CPU cores and 16GB RAM, automatically resizing large images and caching recent results for improved performance. The backend uses DeepFace with OpenCV for face detection and emotion classification, supporting up to 10 faces per image with a maximum image size of 1024px, and includes comprehensive error handling, request validation, and health monitoring endpoints. All communication is secured via HTTPS, and no personal data is stored or logged - images are processed in memory and immediately discarded for privacy protection.
